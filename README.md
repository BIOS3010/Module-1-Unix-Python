# Module 1: Learning the basics of Bash/UNIX (and repeating Python)
In the exercises below, all commands that should be run in the shell are shown:

```bash
Like this
```
In some places, there are tasks for you to do, or questions where you are meant to write down your answer. These are written
```diff
!Like this
```

**1.1 Install a shell on your computer**
- Show here

**1.2 Learning how to navigate in your file system
* Do [these exercises](exercises/Unix-1.md)

Then:
- rmdir
- cp
- mv
- rm

And finally:
- cat
- head
- tail
- wc
- grep
- sort
- uniq









* Idea: Make your own cheat sheet. Each breakout-group gets assigned a unique set of commands (ls, cd, pwd, etc.), and should describe each and show an example in the terminal. Report on Padlet?

# Python exercises
* Read [this guide](exercises/guide_getting_started_with_python.md) if you need help to get Python installed on your computer.
* [Repetition](exercises/Python-exercise1.md) ([Solution](solutions/Exercise1-solution.py))
