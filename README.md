# Module 1: Learning the basics of Bash/UNIX (and repeating Python)
**1. Install a shell on your computer**





* Read [this guide](guide_getting_started_with_python.md) if you need help to get Python installed on your computer.

# Python exercises
* [Repetition](Python-exercise1.md) ([Solution](solutions/Exercise1-solution.py))

# Unix exercises
In these exercises, you will first try out some basic UNIX commands, and then you will work in groups afterwards. You will learn about the follow UNIX commands and concepts:

**Install gitbash**

**Creating, moving and deleting files**
- mkdir
- rmdir
- cp
- mv
- rm

**1. Entering your home directory: `cd`** 
Type in the following command in the terminal
```bash
cd
```
This command will take you back to your home/user directory.

**3. Moving around in the file system** 
To navigate into the newly created folder (with the name BIOS3010), type in the following command:
```bash
cd BIOS3010
```
**4. Using the `pwd` command** 
Type in:
```bash
pwd
```
```diff
! What got printed to the screen when you used the `pwd` command?
```

**5. etc.** 


**2. Creating a new directory: `mkdir`** 



* Idea: Make your own cheat sheet. Each breakout-group gets assigned a unique set of commands (ls, cd, pwd, etc.), and should describe each and show an example in the terminal. Report on Padlet?
